Backlog Manager allows you to add media, such as movies and series, as well as video games to your backlog. It can be used as a tool to help you prioritize what you would like to finish or watch next, while also updating the progress on the current thing. It can be set to "in progress" or "completed", and you can also update it to "dropped" in case you didn't like it while watching or playing it.
